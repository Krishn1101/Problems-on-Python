"""Given three numbers a, b, and c. You need to find which is the greatest of them all.

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Clearly, c = 3 is the greatest of (1, 2, 3)
Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: Out of (2, 2, 5) 5 is the greatest."""

                                            #CODE HERE:-

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(max(a,b,c))
