"""You are given a stack st of n integers and an element x. You have to insert x at the bottom of the given stack. 

Note: Everywhere in this problem, the bottommost element of the stack is shown first while priniting the stack.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
x = 2
st = {4,3,2,1,8}
Output:
{2,4,3,2,1,8}
Explanation:
After insertion of 2, the final stack will be {2,4,3,2,1,8}.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
x = 4
st = {5,3,1}
Output:
{4,5,3,1}
Explanation:
After insertion of 4, the final stack will be {4,5,3,1}."""
