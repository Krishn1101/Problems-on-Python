"""You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase alphabets. Your task is to remove consecutive duplicate characters from the string. 

Example:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output:  "ab" 
Explanation: 
The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed.
Similarly, the character 'b' at index 4 is the same as 'b' at index 3, so it is removed.
The final string is "ab".
Input:s = "aabaa"
Output: "aba"
Explanation: 
The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed.
The character 'a' at index 5 is the same as 'a' at index 4, so it is removed.
The final string is "aba".
Input: s = "abcddcba"
Output: "abcdcba"
Explanation: 
The character 'd' at index 5 is the same as 'd' at index 4, so it is removed.
No other consecutive duplicates exist.
The final string is "abcdcba"."""
