"""Given an array arr[], swap the kth element from the beginning with the kth element from the end.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8]
Explanation: 3rd element from beginning is 3 and 3rd element from end is 6, so we replace 3 & 6.
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 6, 1, 2], k = 2
Output: [5, 1, 6, 3, 2]
Explanation: 2nd element from beginning is 3 and from end is 1."""

                                        #CODE HERE:-

    def swapKth(self, arr, k):
        arr[k-1],arr[-k] = arr[-k],arr[k-1]
        return arr
